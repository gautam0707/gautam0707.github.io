I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, working under the joint supervision of [Dr. Rebekka Burkholz](https://sites.google.com/view/rebekkaburkholz/) and [Dr. Krikamol Muandet](https://www.krikamol.org/). My research focuses on causal representation learning, statistical causal inference, causal modeling of machine learning and deep learning models, and neurosymbolic AI. Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, where I was advised by [Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/index.html).
