My research focuses on causal modeling of machine learning and deep learning models and statistical causal inference. I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, where I was advised by [Prof. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/index.html).
